### **Booting Sequence (Detailed Steps)**

1. **Power On:**  
   The PSU supplies power to the motherboard and all components.

2. **BIOS/UEFI Initialization:**  
   Firmware in ROM is activated, which begins hardware checks.

3. **Power-On Self-Test (POST):**  
   The system checks CPU, RAM, storage, and essential peripherals for faults.  
   - If POST fails, error codes or beeps indicate the problem.
   - If POST passes, the system continues booting.

4. **Hardware Initialization:**  
   BIOS/UEFI configures detected hardware and prepares the system for boot.

5. **Peripheral Detection & Configuration:**  
   All connected devices are detected and configured.

6. **Boot Device Search:**  
   BIOS/UEFI checks the boot order (e.g., SSD, HDD, USB) for a device with a valid bootloader.

7. **Bootloader Execution:**  
   The bootloader (MBR for BIOS, EFI for UEFI) is loaded from the boot device.

8. **Load Operating System Kernel:**  
   The OS kernel is loaded into RAM, taking control of the system.

9. **OS Initialization:**  
   The OS loads drivers and system services, preparing for user interaction.

10. **User Login Prompt:**  
    The user is prompted to log in and can begin using the system.
